    <p>
        When including your educational qualifications on a resume, it's essential to provide accurate and relevant information. Typically, this section should be placed near the top of your resume, especially if you are a recent graduate or your education is a key qualification for the position. Here's a format you can follow:
[Degree Earned]<br>
[University/College Name]<br>
[Location]<br>
[Major/Field of Study]<br>
[Month and Year of Graduation]<br>
Include any academic honors or relevant coursework if it strengthens your application. If you have multiple degrees or certifications, list them in reverse chronological order.
